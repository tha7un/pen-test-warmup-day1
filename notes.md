# my Daily pentest recall progression


Day 1 — Warmup (Nov 3)
- Goal: tool refresh, basic nmap + ffuf scans, create toolbox commands.
- Safety: testing only on lab IP *******
- Focus: 1 useful command to remember today


Today focus (Nmap Commands):
- Nmap allows you to scan your network and discover not only everything connected to it, but also a wide variety of information about what's connected, what services each host is operating, and so on.
- It allows a large number of scanning techniques, such as UDP, TCP connect (), TCP SYN (half-open), and FTP
- It also offers a wide variety of scan types, including Proxy (bounce attack), Reverse-ident, ICMP (ping sweep), FIN, ACK sweep, Xmas, SYN sweep, IP Protocol, and Null scan.


- NOTE: See the man page's Scan Techniques section for more details. {cmd}: < man nmap>
